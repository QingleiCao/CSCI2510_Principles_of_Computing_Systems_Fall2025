1.) It began letting me type on my keyboard and after I press enter it repeated back what I just wrote. Then after ctrl d it stopped and went back to letting me
input commands

2.) It printed the txt contants of mars.txt

3.) Using nano new.txt to access the files, it seemed that new.txt just copied the text from mars.txt into itself. Pretty cool!

4.) It replaced the original text with what I inputd into the terminal

5.) Insteaed of rewriting it this time, it just picked up where the old text left off but on the next line.

6.) My header was   #include <unistd.h>, so ill be using that

8.) its a number > 0 or 0 if it is at end of file and -1 for an error

9.) Yes it matches

10.) I dont know for sure but I think that it would affect correctness as if might reach the byte limit easier depending on the value

11.) the smaller probably the more correct but also prolly slower as it would have to do more iterations of the loop and bigger would be faster but less correct or 
maybe smaller uses less memory space and is slower and bigger uses more but is faster
